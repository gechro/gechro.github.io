      <p>This week at DBC Phase 0, Geovanna edition :      </p>

      <p>HTML and CSS! ;-P</p>

      <p>So this week we learned all about making our page pretty. HTML is the markup language we use to give our page structure. It’s the bones to the page. Made up of a '<head>'' and '<body>'. Within the head and both we have elements like '<title>', '<header>', '<main>', '<footer>', and many more. </p>
      <p>CSS enables us to add a skin to our page. We use the elements named above and assign properties to them. What color is the text? What color background? What size is this box, or that photo, or this button? That’s the easy stuff. CSS is more than just adding visuals to the elements. It’s about positioning. It’s actually A LOT about positioning. But before we can even touch positioning we need to keep something very important in mind.</p>
      <p>An object is more than just the size you give it. It’s position is going to depend on the margin, border, and padding. Let’s go through what each is first, and then we can take a look at the diagram below.</p>
     <p>The border is exactly what it is in any situation.  It’s an outline. It goes around our element.</p>
     <p>The margin is an invisible area that lies right outside the border of the object.</p>
     <p>The padding is also transparent, but lies right inside the border, and around the content (usually text, sometimes an image, or just blank space.)</p>
     <p>It’s easy to get lost in all this new terminology. The best way though to actually understand something, is to visualize it.</p>
     <p>Take a look at the diagram now:</p>
     <img src="../imgs/box-model.png">
    <p>The content is your element. For the sake of a simple web page, the margin is usually the space in the body. The distance from the margin would be measured from the outer edges of the webpage.</p>
    <p>The padding would be the space around the link, photo, box, button, paragraph, or anything really. If you were to draw a border (or box) around any of these elements, the padding would be right inside of it.</p>
    <p>So before you dive into CSS, ask yourself, “Am I in, or am I out?” (of your element –no pun intended :-P) Keep in mind that objects will be affected by the margin, border, and padding. This will save you the headache of having to figure out why something isn’t exactly where you want it. Until next time!</p>
