      <p>
      A few weeks ago, I checked out a link that Dev Bootcamp had sent prior to the start of Phase 0. It included a quiz and covered information on different thinking styles. DBC encouraged us to take the test and learn what our style was.  The four types of thinking are Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, Concrete Random, and Abstract Random. On the quiz, I scored evenly for Concrete Random and Abstract Random.
      </p>
      <p>
      According to Anthony Gregorc, Concrete Random thinkers are experimenters. I find this to be a true reflection of my thinking style. I learn a lot by doing things hands on. As I read things, I like to experiment and try them out to see what the results are. I tend to be a little competitive(in a friendly way :-) ) and because of this I work best alone.
      </p>

      <p>
      However, as an equally Abstract Thinker, I like to listen to what others have to say. This makes working in a group, or pair, doable. Because I am also an Abstract Random Thinker, I can focus on the issues at hand and combine that with my more Concrete side to find a solution.
      </p>

      <p>
      With both of these thinking styles, the Phase 0 portion of my journey with DBC  is a little more difficult. I tend to stray from routine, and with the remote learning experience, it's important to have some sort of organized routine to stay on track. So this is something I must continue to work on.
     </p>

      <p>
      Overall, knowing my thinking style positively impacts my goal of becoming a Web Developer through DBC. I've always possessed a growth mindset. So I am dedicated to excelling in as many areas as I possibly can. Not even the sky is my limit!
