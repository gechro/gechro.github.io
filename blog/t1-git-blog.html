  <h1>Git It? Got It? Good!</h1>
  <h2><span class="special">Git</span>ting Familiar with Version Control</h2>
  <h4>February 8, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Hey Everyone!
    </p>
    <p>
        Today marks the end of Phase 0, Unit 1, week 1 for us 2015 Pocket Gophers. Yay! Now we’re actually <em>gitting</em> somewhere! (I’m all for wordplay btw! ;) )
    </p>
    <p>
      Week 1 was all about version control, namely git and GitHub. I had seen a few things about git, online, over the past few weeks, and to be honest I had no clue what to do with it, even after the ‘Try Git’ tutorial. After completing Week 1, I realized why I felt some trepidation about getting started with the week’s work in the first place. I felt intimidated by the topic. I had no clue what git <em>actually</em> was. I mean I knew it tracked changes. But I didn’t know how, or what category git even fell under.
    </p>
    <p>
       Cue <strong>version control</strong>! What exactly is version control, you may ask? Version control is just a method of tracking changes to a file. It lets you know <em>what</em> changes were made, <em>who</em> made them, <em>when</em> they were made, and sometimes we even get the thought process behind <em>why</em> the changes were made. Git and GitHub are types of version control. They are super similar and work together. They are not the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Git lives on your computer or laptop. It is a ‘local’ type of version control. This means that it does not need an internet connection to track your changes. If you’re working alone, git allows you to make changes to a file, without losing the original, or having to create a new file names or versions of the file (example: File.doc, File_copy.doc, File_copy_copy.doc). If you decide you don’t like the changes, going back to the original is easy peasy. When doing group work, git allows multiple users to work on the file, while tracking those changes as well. It avoids a big mess.
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub works with git. GitHub is a ‘remote’ type of version control. Meaning it lives on the internet. It is like ‘Cloud’ in a way.  It stores what you send to it from your computer. GitHub is very beneficial because it allows for your group or team to see and edit your work, even if you aren’t working side-by-side or even at the same time. Again, your original file, remains safe. GitHub makes it way easy to view files, and it even lists the changes right there. </p>
      <p>
        So, that’s just a little background on what git and GitHub are all about. Hopefully after reading this, you can feel more comfortable learning about it. I spent maybe 1 full day, and it definitely was not as hard or as intimidating as I thought. I <b>git</b> it now (Okay, I’ll stop lol.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I will be updating this blog as we progress with Phase 0! Good luck to all fellow Pocket Gophers, and those looking to get started!
