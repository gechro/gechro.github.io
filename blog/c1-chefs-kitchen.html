  <h1>What's cooking at DBC?</h1>
  <h2>A Reflection on Kitchen vs. Table</h2>
  <h4>February 8, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      So here we are, at the end of Week 1 of Phase 1 at Dev Bootcamp. I am so happy to have decided to apply, and then enroll with DBC. The whole culture really speaks to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love that DBC seems to care about their students as people. This is evident in the way that they kind of filter the kind of students they want. Passionate, Humble, Confident, Commited, Inspired, Hungry, Empathetic... these are just a few of the traits DBC is lookng for in its students.
    </p>

    <p>
      Why is this so important? Does it really matter? Isn't it just enough to learn what you have to learn? No, it's not. DBC likes to ensure their students are working in a comfortable environment. In the Fireside Chat, Shereef made an excellent point. The students need to possess these qualities, because these are people you are going to be spending hours on top of hours with. No one wants to work with an arrogrant or obnoxious person, no matter how good they are at their job.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to caring about a comfortable and pleasant work environment, DBC also cares about the physical and mental well-being of their students. Yoga! This is so that we get that much needed mental break and don't crash.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am all about creativity, I'm all about health and well-being, and I'm all about tech. DBC and me? I think we'll get along just fine :) So far at the end of Week 1, I feel 110% sure that DBC was the right choice for me. I am really looking forward to meeting others with similar goals; those looking to grow as individuals and as developers.
    </p>

    <p> For those of you who are considering Dev Bootcamp, it's definitely a great experience so far! The networking and social aspect alone are great. The prep work is so clear. There's just nothing negative to say so far. I'm beyond excited.
    </p>

    <p> What about my fellow Pocket Gophers? How are you guys feeling? Looking forward to reading your blogs. Will check them out via Twitter. Good luck on Week 2!
