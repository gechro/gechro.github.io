      <h2>On Pairing and Feedback</h2>
      <h4>March 9, 2015</h4>

      <p>
        One of the requirements for DBC's Phase 0 is Pair Programming. We have to make sure that we pair with another student from our cohort (can be from any location) <span class="special">at least</span> twice a week, for at least 45 minutes per session.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, I was dreading the whole pairing thing. I'm the kind of person that works best alone, not because I'm not a people person, but because I usually like to keep things at my own pace. I also tend to kind of think things through in my head and on paper, so verbally expressing my ideas would be a little challenging.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pairing has proved to be the opposite. I mean there are days when I feel like I don't want to pair, but when it comes down to it i ALWAYS enjoy it. There has not been a single pair challenge, to date, that was not beneficial. I learn something new every time. It can be something as simple as syntax shortcuts, or even a different methods that give the same output.
      </p>

      <p>
        I feel that when I pair, and am required to verbally express what I want to do, or what I expect will happen, it cements things I've learned or read about. So as of right now, I enjoy pairing. The only thing I don't always agree with are the mandatory pair challenges. I kind of enjoy choosing the challenges to pair on. Sometimes I feel like some challenges are more appropriate to pair on than others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Feedback is another weekly requirement. For each pairing session, we are to leave feedback on our experience. So far I mostly agree with the feedback that I've received.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am very open to constructive criticism. Most of my feedback has one common trait, and it's something I was aware of from the start: verbally communicating my thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the weeks go, I try to pair more than the minimum requirement, so that I can work on my communication skills. I've started to tell my pairing partners, what I am going to do (ahead of time) and making sure that they're clear on why, before proceeding.
      </p>

      <p>Pairing and leaving feedback has also helped me outside of DBC. I am applying similar principles in my personal life. Overall, I look forward to continuing with these two concepts through Phase 0, and beyond.</p>
