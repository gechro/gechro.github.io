    <h1>Hello DBC!</h1>
    <p> I’m Geovanna. I’m from right here in NY. Super thrilled to finally have joined Dev Bootcamp!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> I'm looking forward to becoming the best developer I can be. Excited to see what it entails, technically, personally, and socially. I really can’t wait for the day that I can actually create something useful! ☺
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> Throughout this process I will be updating you all with my feelings on the program, my triumphs, and oops moments!
    </p>

    <h2> Enjoy and welcome to my page!</h2>
